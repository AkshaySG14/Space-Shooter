# Space-Shooter

Space Shooter is a desktop game that resembles a basic shooter platformer. It is a 2-D platformer where the player controls a small 
box that is able to shoot bullets. The game's objectives are simple: the player must reach the end door of each of the three levels 
and must take care to avoid enemies along the way to win. The game's premise and its controls are simple and easy to 
understand.

Space Shooter is operated through the keyboard exclusively. The player uses the WASD keys to maneuver through the game, and J 
to shoot. 

The game was written in ruby, and utilizes the Gosu framework for rendering the game. Unlike the other games I have made, excluding the drawing and rendering 
of the sprites in the game, the game engine was entirely designed by myself, from the creation of the manner through 
which the game is generated, to the way the game objects are rendered. What is seen on the screen was created through the combination 
of a pixel map and the use of a custom-made camera. 

A MAC ONLY application is available for examination or for perusal. This application is essentially a ruby launcher for 
the game.
